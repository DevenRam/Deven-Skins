# [Generic HDDT](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1FaAFZQozLmhfTD9uQW0CvIgv7p3-T9fH)
The non-personalized version of my Rafis HDDT no weeb edit.  I don't actually use this, I just think it's good for people who like my DT edit, but don't want the personalization.

This also includes a generic Rafis style scorebar that can be personalized with [this PSD template.](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1b934NqrD43_Ifdo9wAi8a_d3gUy9i1kh) DM me on Discord DevenRam#0855 if you need help editing the template for yourself or if you don't have photoshop.  I'll be more than happy to help if I'm not busy.
